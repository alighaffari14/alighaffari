- 👋 Hi, I’m @alighaffari14
- 👀 I’m a Full Stack Dotnet developer with C# at heart, working on both frontend and backend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dotnet Core & Angular as well for browser based applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Resturant/Shop POS & ERP Project that I am going to make open source. 
     The Idea is to help new & small businesses maintain an e-record of their sales and manage their inventory better.
     It will be based on Tkinter.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email : alighaffari12@hotmail.com
